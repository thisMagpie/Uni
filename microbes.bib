to me 
i have no idea how to export my references as a bib file. i'm being really stupid here.
i've put a number in little square brackets like this [1] where my reference should be. the keyword/tag on the reference includes the number. lemme know if you need me to do anything else. i've never referenced like this before in latex.

@article{McPherson:1993:Microgravity-Sci-Technol:11541857,
  abstract = {Macromolecules crystals are indispensable intermediates in the analysis of macromolecular structure, are essential for the application of x-ray diffraction methods, and are at the same time the greatest obstacle to success. Protein crystals are generally difficult to grow, often of imperfect form or small size, and frequently lack sufficient order. Their growth has become the rate limiting step in x-ray crystallography. Evidence has emerged from protein crystallization experiments carried out in space that suggests macromolecular crystals of improved order and quality can be grown in a microgravity environment. Presumably the absence of density driven convection and sedimentation permits a more deliberate and graceful entry of individual molecules into the crystal lattice. This in turn results in improvements in both morphology and the diffraction patterns of the crystals. The precise mechanisms for these improvements and the means for their optimization are, however, not understood at more than a rudimentary level. I attempt here to review microgravity effects that may play a role in protein crystal growth, sedimentation, convection and surface contact, and suggest their possible mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations have reported that space flight may produce a stimulating effect on microbial metabolism; however, the specific underlying mechanisms associated with the observed changes have not yet been identified. In an effort to systematically evaluate the effect of space flight on each phase of microbial growth (lag, exponential and stationary), a series of experiments was carried out using in vitro suspension cultures of Escherichia coli aboard seven US Space Shuttle missions. The results indicated that, as a result of space flight, the lag phase was shortened, the duration of exponential growth was increased, and the final cell population density was approximately doubled. A model was derived from these cumulative data in an attempt t associate gravity-dependent, extracellular transport phenomena with unique changes observed in each specific phase of growth. It is suggested that a cumulative effect of gravity may have a significant impact on suspended cells via their fluid environment, where an immediate, direct influence of gravity might otherwise be deemed negligible.},

  abstract = {Cultures of Escherichia coli grown in space reached a 25% higher average final cell population than those in comparably matched ground controls (p<0.05). However, both groups consumed the same quantity of glucose, which suggests that space flight not only stimulated bacterial growth as has been previously reported, but also resulted in a 25% more efficient utilization of the available nutrients. Supporting experiments performed in "simulated weightlessness" under clinorotation produced similar trends of increased growth and efficiency, but to a lesser extent in absolute values. These experiments resulted in increases of 12% and 9% in average final cell population (p<0.05), while the efficiency of substrate utilization improved by 6% and 9% relative to static controls (p=0.12 and p<0.05, respectively). In contrast, hypergravity, produced by centrifugation, predictably resulted in the opposite effect--a decrease of 33% to 40% in final cell numbers with corresponding 29% to 40% lower net growth efficiencies (p<0.01). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that the increased bacterial growth observed in weightlessness is a result of reduced extracellular mass transport that occurs in the absence of sedimentation and buoyancy-driven convection, which consequently also improves substrate utilization efficiency in suspended cultures.},

  abstract = {Lag phase represents the earliest and most poorly understood stage of the bacterial growth cycle. We developed a reproducible experimental system and conducted functional genomic and physiological analyses of a 2-h lag phase in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Adaptation began within 4 min of inoculation into fresh LB medium with the transient expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake. The main lag-phase transcriptional program initiated at 20 min with the upregulation of 945 genes encoding processes such as transcription, translation, iron-sulfur protein assembly, nucleotide metabolism, LPS biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration. ChIP-chip revealed that RNA polymerase was not “poised” upstream of the bacterial genes that are rapidly induced at the beginning of lag phase, suggesting a mechanism that involves de novo partitioning of RNA polymerase to transcribe 522 bacterial genes within 4 min of leaving stationary phase. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to discover that iron, calcium, and manganese are accumulated by S. Typhimurium during lag phase, while levels of cobalt, nickel, and sodium showed distinct growth-phase-specific patterns. The high concentration of iron during lag phase was associated with transient sensitivity to oxidative stress. The study of lag phase promises to identify the physiological and regulatory processes responsible for adaptation to new environments.},

  abstract = {The responses of microorganisms (viruses, bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and lichens) to selected factors of space (microgravity, galactic cosmic radiation, solar UV radiation, and space vacuum) were determined in space and laboratory simulation experiments. In general, microorganisms tend to thrive in the space flight environment in terms of enhanced growth parameters and a demonstrated ability to proliferate in the presence of normally inhibitory levels of antibiotics. The mechanisms responsible for the observed biological responses, however, are not yet fully understood. A hypothesized interaction of microgravity with radiation-induced DNA repair processes was experimentally refuted. The survival of microorganisms in outer space was investigated to tackle questions on the upper boundary of the biosphere and on the likelihood of interplanetary transport of microorganisms. It was found that extraterrestrial solar UV radiation was the most deleterious factor of space. Among all organisms tested, only lichens (Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans) maintained full viability after 2 weeks in outer space, whereas all other test systems were inactivated by orders of magnitude. Using optical filters and spores of Bacillus subtilis as a biological UV dosimeter, it was found that the current ozone layer reduces the biological effectiveness of solar UV by 3 orders of magnitude. If shielded against solar UV, spores of B. subtilis were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called lithopanspermia hypothesis.},

The most important ones are the changes in the system of signaling pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors, TLRs), which manifest themselves as a decrease in the content and cytokine-producing ability of monocytes and granulocytes expressing TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6, as well as in the suppression of the functional potential of natural killer (NK)- and T-cell components of adaptive immunity and are discussed.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device for generating multidirectional G force, resulting in an environment with an average of 10(3) G. Here we report that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured in a 3D-clinostat (group CL) showed marked proliferation (13-fold in a week) compared with cells cultured under normal conditions of 1 G (group C) (4-fold in a week). Flow cytometry revealed a 6-fold increase in the number of hMSCs double-positive for CD44/CD29 or CD90/CD29 in group CL after 7 days in culture, compared with group C. Telomere length remained the same in cells from both groups during culturing. Group C cells showed increasing expression levels of type II collagen and aggrecan over the culture period, whereas group CL cells showed a decrease to undetectable levels. Pellets of hMSCs from each group were explanted into cartilagedefective mice. The transplants from group CL formed hyaline cartilage after 7 days, whereas the transplants from group C formed only noncartilage tissue containing a small number of cells. These results show that hMSCs cultured in a 3D-clinostat possess the strong proliferative characteristic of stem cells and retain their ability to differentiate into hyaline cartilage after transplantation. On the contrary, cells cultured in a 1-G environment do not maintain these features. Simulated microgravity may thus provide an environment to successfully expand stem cell populations in vitro without culture supplements that can adversely affect stem cell-derived transplantations. This method has significant potential for regenerative medicine and developmental biology.},

The Center for Macromolecular Crystallography (CMC) has devoted considerable effort studying the fundamental processes involved in macromolecular crystal growth both in a 1-g and microgravity environment. Results from experiments performed on more than 35 U.S. space shuttle flights have clearly indicated that microgravity can provide a beneficial environment for macromolecular crystal growth. This research has led to the development of a new generation of pharmaceuticals that are currently in preclinical or clinical trials for diseases such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, influenza, stroke and other cardiovascular complications. The International Space Station (ISS) provides an opportunity to have complete crystallographic capability on orbit, which was previously not possible with the space shuttle orbiter. As envisioned, the x-ray Crystallography Facility (XCF) will be a complete facility for growing protein crystals; selecting, harvesting, and mounting sample crystals for x-ray diffraction; cryo-freezing mounted crystals if necessary; performing x-ray diffraction studies; and downlinking the data for use by crystallographers on the ground. Other advantages of such a facility include crystal characterization so that iterations in the crystal growth conditions can be made, thereby optimizing the final crystals produced in a three month interval on the ISS.},

  abstract = {Gravity is the only environmental parameter that has remained constant during the period of evolution of living matter on Earth. Thus, it must have been a major force in shaping living things. The influence of gravitational loading in evolution of the vertebrate skeleton is well recognized, and scale effects have been studied. This paper, however, considers in addition four pivotal events in early evolution that would seem to have been significant for the later success and diversification of animal life. These are evolution of the cytoskeleton, cell motility (flagellae and cilia), gravity detecting devices (accelerometers), and biomineralization. All are functionally calcium dependent in eukaryotes and all occurred or were foreshadowed in prokaryotes. A major question is why calcium was selected as an ion of great importance to the structure and function of living matter; another is whether gravity played a role in its selection.},

  abstract =3D {A three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is a device for generati=
ng multidirectional G force, resulting in an environment with an average of=
 10(3) G. Here we report that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured=
 in a 3D-clinostat (group CL) showed marked proliferation (13-fold in a wee=
k) compared with cells cultured under normal conditions of 1 G (group C) (4=
-fold in a week). Flow cytometry revealed a 6-fold increase in the number o=
f hMSCs double-positive for CD44/CD29 or CD90/CD29 in group CL after 7 days=
 in culture, compared with group C. Telomere length remained the same in ce=
lls from both groups during culturing. Group C cells showed increasing expr=
ession levels of type II collagen and aggrecan over the culture period, whe=
reas group CL cells showed a decrease to undetectable levels. Pellets of hM=
SCs from each group were explanted into cartilagedefective mice. The transp=
lants from group CL formed hyaline cartilage after 7 days, whereas the tran=
splants from group C formed only noncartilage tissue containing a small num=
ber of cells. These results show that hMSCs cultured in a 3D-clinostat poss=
ess the strong proliferative characteristic of stem cells and retain their =
ability to differentiate into hyaline cartilage after transplantation. On t=
he contrary, cells cultured in a 1-G environment do not maintain these feat=
ures. Simulated microgravity may thus provide an environment to successfull=
y expand stem cell populations in vitro without culture supplements that ca=
n adversely affect stem cell-derived transplantations. This method has sign=
ificant potential for regenerative medicine and developmental biology.},

  abstract =3D {Protein structural information plays a key role in understa=

 new pharmaceuticals for both chronic and infectious diseases. The Center f=
or Macromolecular Crystallography (CMC) has devoted considerable effort stu=
dying the fundamental processes involved in macromolecular crystal growth b=
oth in a 1-g and microgravity environment. Results from experiments perform=
ed on more than 35 U.S. space shuttle flights have clearly indicated that m=
icrogravity can provide a beneficial environment for macromolecular crystal=
 growth. This research has led to the development of a new generation of ph=
armaceuticals that are currently in preclinical or clinical trials for dise=
ases such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, AI=
DS, influenza, stroke and other cardiovascular complications. The Internati=
onal Space Station (ISS) provides an opportunity to have complete crystallo=
graphic capability on orbit, which was previously not possible with the spa=
ce shuttle orbiter. As envisioned, the x-ray Crystallography Facility (XCF)=
 will be a complete facility for growing protein crystals; selecting, harve=
sting, and mounting sample crystals for x-ray diffraction; cryo-freezing mo=
unted crystals if necessary; performing x-ray diffraction studies; and down=
linking the data for use by crystallographers on the ground. Other advantag=
es of such a facility include crystal characterization so that iterations i=
n the crystal growth conditions can be made, thereby optimizing the final c=
rystals produced in a three month interval on the ISS.},

 it must have been a major force in shaping living things. The influence of=
 gravitational loading in evolution of the vertebrate skeleton is well reco=

 in addition four pivotal events in early evolution that would seem to have=
 been significant for the later success and diversification of animal life.=
 These are evolution of the cytoskeleton, cell motility (flagellae and cili=
a), gravity detecting devices (accelerometers), and biomineralization. All =
are functionally calcium dependent in eukaryotes and all occurred or were f=

 an ion of great importance to the structure and function of living matter;=
 another is whether gravity played a role in its selection.},
